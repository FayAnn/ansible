Role directory structure
An Ansible role has a defined directory structure with seven main standard directories. You must include at least one of these directories in each role. You can omit any directories the role does not use. For example:

# playbooks
site.yml
webservers.yml
fooservers.yml
roles/
    common/
        tasks/
        handlers/
        library/
        files/
        templates/
        vars/
        defaults/
        meta/
    webservers/
        tasks/
        defaults/
        meta/


By default Ansible will look in each directory within a role for a main.yml file for relevant content (also main.yaml and main):

    tasks/main.yml - the main list of tasks that the role executes.

    handlers/main.yml - handlers, which may be used within or outside this role.

    library/my_module.py - modules, which may be used within this role (see Embedding modules and plugins in roles for more information).

    defaults/main.yml - default variables for the role (see Using Variables for more information). These variables have the lowest priority of any variables available, and can be easily overridden by any other variable, including inventory variables.

    vars/main.yml - other variables for the role (see Using Variables for more information).

    files/main.yml - files that the role deploys.

    templates/main.yml - templates that the role deploys.

    meta/main.yml - metadata for the role, including role dependencies.


Storing and finding roles
By default, Ansible looks for roles in two locations:

    in a directory called roles/, relative to the playbook file

    in /etc/ansible/roles

If you store your roles in a different location, set the roles_path configuration option so Ansible can find your roles. Checking shared roles into a single location makes them easier to use in multiple playbooks. See Configuring Ansible for details about managing settings in ansible.cfg.

Alternatively, you can call a role with a fully qualified path:

---
- hosts: webservers
  roles:
    - role: '/path/to/my/roles/common'

Using roles
You can use roles in three ways:

  at the play level with the roles option: This is the classic way of using roles in a play.

  at the tasks level with include_role: You can reuse roles dynamically anywhere in the tasks section of a play using include_role.

  at the tasks level with import_role: You can reuse roles statically anywhere in the tasks section of a play using import_role.
